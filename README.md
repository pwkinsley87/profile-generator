# profile-generator

The purpose of this app is to allow an individual to create a Team Profile. The app avails itself of Node, Jest, HTML, and Javascript. When a user logs onto the app, they are prompted to fill in relevant information such as: an Employees' name, an Employees' ID, an Employees' email address, the employees' role. If the user selects "Manager", they are prompted to enter the Office Number, which is the phone number for the Manager. If the user selects "Engineer", they are prompted to provide the Enineers' GitHub information. If the user selects "Intern", they are prompted to enter the Interns' university information. Once all the relevant information has been entered, the program constructs the team profile in an HTML file. Ideally, the links to the team members' email addresses and the Engineers' Github username would all be live and would link to their appropriate modal windows/web pages, but I have not gotten that to be functional yet. Also, although Bootstrap was implemented, there are obviously major style issues with the finished profile. I intend to resolve these at a later date as well.
